Road Map For The Project With No Specific Order.

1. Users will bet with the chess engine.
    
    - users must have account with Game9ja with enough account balance to be eligible.

    - game timeout is only applicable to the user. Timeout will not affect the game engine
      when searching for best move because the user may cheat in such situation putting the
      engine in disadvantage. One way the user can cheat the game engine is by using low performance
      device (computer or mobile device) which may cause the engine to fail to beat its timeout thus
      putting it in disadvantage position to lose the game.

    - For very high rank user the engine may occasionally get best move from remote server. Or in some
      situations get all best moves from a server dedicated to him alone.  Note that for a server to be 
      dedicated to a user his stake (money bet) for the game must worth that facility. The dedicated server
      could be a cloud for running the code to search best move. More research on this later.



2. Users will bet with one anther.

    - users must have account with Game9ja with enough account balance to be eligible.

3. Users will play in tournaments.
